# My Website/Blog

Source code to my website and blog which is currently hosted at [here](https://isaacguglielmin.com)

This was my first attempt at making a website from a couple months ago which was built heavily using a tutorial video, so I apologise
in advance if the styling and formatting is awful. One day I will get around to tidying it all up, but for now it gets the job done
and as a primary backend developer I can't be too ashamed at my first attempt.
