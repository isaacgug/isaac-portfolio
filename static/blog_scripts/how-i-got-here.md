# How I Got Here
If I could sum up my twenties so far it would be uneventful to say the least. Leaving high school I found myself lost for purpose, I tried university studying a Bachelor of Arts. That wasn't it. I then tried working a trade, turns out, also not it and I am not cut out for that kind of work.

When you're young there's an insurmountable amount of pressure to know what you're doing or where you're going. I think this can lead us down paths that aren't the right fits for us and unfortunately we can end up feeling stuck and that we can't make a change.

During my short lived one year of working a trade I began to reflect more. Who am I ? And what is it exactly that I want to do? I believed I was smart enough to do something interesting but I was never sure what. At that time I was watching a bunch of [CarlSagan42](https://www.youtube.com/@CarlSagan42) as I had an extreme obsession with Mario Maker. Despite his hilarious game play, some of my favourite parts of his videos is where he would do Q&A's about his job and his love for science.

Hearing his passion of learning and science and how that could be a career reminded me of being a kid and how much I loved it too. How I was obsessed with space, technology, computers. It made me ask myself, what if I did that too? So I began to look into career paths both Science related and Science adjacent. Somehow I ended up deciding on Electrical Engineering and it was a decision I'll never regret.

In 2018 I applied to University at QUT for a Bachelor of Engineering with the intention to major in Electrical Engineering. In that degree I was introduced to two things that I cherish today. One was programming and the other is the small group of friends I made in one of my first classes. This was back in 2018 and I have the pleasure of not only calling these people my friends to this day, I have just started working alongside one of them at a startup to which I am forever in his debt for the opportunity (we'll come back to this).

University was a fine time for me, I was learning anything anyone would teach me and I had this spark for giving my academics and learning my all. It did help by being motivated by my friends who were as driven as me, so there was a friendly rivalry there I always felt. There were many great opportunities I received there, I had the opportunity to become a Tutor and teach classes of 20-30 students Electrical Signal Analysis where I found I have a real talent and love for teaching and mentoring.

Despite my enjoyment in Electrical Engineering I found myself always loving the programming side of the degree more. I loved the simplicity of a requirements sheet and solving the problem in my own creative way to meet these requirements.

I sat down with my friend who I work with now and we both echoed the same sentiment. We both wanted to become Software Engineers, not Electrical. So without much effort we convinced ourselves to change degrees to Computer Science and the rest is history.

I finished my degree with a Bachelor of Computer Science graduating with Honours and managed to land myself a job at Boeing (with the help of my friend who I now work with, he helped me with my cover letter and resume. He truly is one of the greatest men I know) on one of their projects responsible for a large Networks and Communications system.

I would spend the next 3.5 years of my life working on this project and maybe through my own negligence or complacency I lost that drive and spark and want to learn more. To try harder. I think I finished university with the mentality that I did the hard yards and now it's time to coast. Well coast I did, and honestly from a learning and career perspective the last 3.5 years have been pretty disappointing. I stopped pushing myself and did the bare minimum, I lost who I was that I had gained during university.

This isn't to say that those 3.5 years were a complete waste. I made great friends to whom I will forever cherish and be grateful for. I learnt quite a lot about Networking and Virtualisation, what it takes to work on large projects with large teams. Maintaining legacy code. Mentoring and coaching graduate/junior engineers and so on. But I always wish I had striven to have more impact on the project. To truly make it better...

Almost 12 months ago to the date I had a rather significant life event occur that would alter my trajectory. No, it wasn't Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree. But man did I play the crap out of that during this period too. For better or worse I was given the opportunity to reflect on who I am, who I want to be. I knew something needed to change I just wasn't sure what. I felt stuck and trapped. Lost. Almost like I did all those years ago after leaving high school.

Enter in my good friend one more time. He had been working at this startup for the last 12 months and during that entire period he took many opportunities to try and convince me to quit Boeing and come work with him developing a SaaS AI based Web App. Most of the time I'd brush it off because I was *comfy*. But when he approached me again with the idea and I was going through this time of change I thought why not? Maybe a new job and a new city would be healthy?

One problem. I am not a full stack developer by trade. Three months ago I couldn't have told you how to center a div. Now I only forget how to do it some of the time. But by knowing I would need to up skill myself I began to self teach Svelte in hopes of passing any sort of coding test I may have coming and just for the job itself. During this period I slowly began to find that drive again. I was so focused on learning for this job interview that I forgot to do much else. I was like my old self at university and I remembered how much I love this.

I remembered how much fun it is to be a Software Engineer experimenting and learning new things. Soon I wasn't just working on Svelte and making this terrible portfolio website/blog you're reading on now, I was working on a personal project to make a task planner web app just for fun. I started watching informational videos in my spare time about best practices of Computer Science and new and exciting technologies. I started watching videos and listening to podcasts about Software Development for entertainment.

Then it happened. I felt like the old me again, that itch to learn and do more was back. So after all of this and finally being prepared for this coding interview, I went in and absolutely bottled it. I've failed many things in my life but that might have been the worse. I froze in the interview, went down a solution path that dug me into a hole and ran out of time. I was convinced that was it. The be all, end all. However, through the powers of nepotism or maybe because our CTO truly believed in me they chose to hire me anyway. Noting I just need to work to improve which is all I ever wanted to be able to do.

So now we arrive at today. Here I am writing my first ever blog post about my life and the rough, mundane and ultimately non inspirational journey of how I found purpose again.

If I've learnt anything on this journey, it's that first of all cherish your friends. Especially those who do things for you without ever expecting anything in return. My friend who I met at university all those years ago, whether he knew it or not, threw me a lifeline. He gave me a chance to prove myself and also reminded me of who I am and what I truly love to do and that's learn and create.

I've also learnt that it's important to reflect. To reflect on my current position and circumstance. What am I grateful for? What am I dissatisfied with? What can I do to change it?

I suppose the biggest lesson I want to leave this blog post with is to never give up on yourself. Never doubt your passions or intelligence because ultimately you're just some hard work away from achieving what you want and who you want to be. And don't be ashamed if you feel you've lost yourself. It happens to everyone. Just try to make the choices to get back to that ideal version of yourself little by little. I promise they're waiting for you.
